# Pac-Man
This is my take on the original Pac-Man game for my final project for my real-time embedded systems class. I used the Pygame library for a lot of the basic game functions, but also created some of my own custom elements. This code was intended to run on a Raspberry Pi with either a keyboard or a joystick and three buttons. See the link below to watch a video demo!
